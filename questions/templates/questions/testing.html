		<h2>Our Story: in brief</h2>
		<p class="text-justify">
			AskDev co-founders, Bhola, Amrit, Prajwal and Jaiprakash, have known each other and been best friends for
			over 10 Days. One day, they asked an open-ended question in one of the online dev
			communities they loved and participated in. While they were waiting for someone to help
			them out and give some advice, they received a ban because open-ended questions weren‚Äôt
			allowed. Needles to say, neither of them saw that coming. ü§∑‚Äç

			At that moment, they realized that there were no online places where developers could
			freely start a discussion and expect to get an opinionated and a friendly answer.
			They did the only thing they could - built such a place themselves. Since day one,
			developers who joined AskDev have had thousands of friendly discussions, wrote
			numerous blog posts, and shared the most interesting links with the rest of community.
			We‚Äôre constantly looking for ways to improve and provide an even better environment for
			all the developers from all the parts of the world.
